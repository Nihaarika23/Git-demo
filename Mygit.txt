I have to work today on this
Day 1
===============================================================
Version Controlling
============================
This is the process of maintaining different versions of the code
All the team members upload their code into the remote version
contolling system.The VCS accepts the code uploads from multiple
team members and creates an aintegrated project.Next time when the
team members download the code they will be able to see all the 
code created by the entire team.The process of uploading into a
VCS is called as checkin and downloading is called as checkout.

VCS's also preserve older and later versions of the code so that
at anypoint we can jump between whichever version that we want

VCS's also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes


VCS's are of two types
1 Centralised Version Controlling System
2 Distributed Version Controlling System

Centralised Version Controlling System
---------------------------------------------
Here we have a remote server where all the team members upload the code
and version controlling happens only on that remote server

Distributed Version Controlling System
------------------------------------------------
Here we have a local repository installed on every team members machine and
version controlling happens here at the level of individual developer,
from the local reposiotry the code is uploaded to the remote repository
where version controlling happens at the level of the entire team

Git uses three sections when working on the local machine
Working directory
Stagging Area
Local Repository

Working Directory is the location where the team initially stores the 
data and all the files present here are initailly called untracked files

Stagging Area is the intermediate buffer zone of git where the files
are sent into and these files are called as stagged files

Local Repository is the location where the files are moved into from the
